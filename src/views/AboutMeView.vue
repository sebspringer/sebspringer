          About
        </h1>
        <p class="mt-8 font-small text-pretty text-gray-400">
          My name is Sebastian, and I'm passionate about frontend and software development, bringing
          15 years of experience and strong collaboration skills to every project.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-8 font-small text-pretty text-gray-400">
          I have experience working with frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular, and my background
          in graphic design helps me bridge the gap between design and development, and create
          user-friendly interfaces. I'm also experienced in Agile and SAFe environments.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-8 font-small text-pretty text-gray-400">
          I've had the opportunity to work in fast-paced, multicultural teams, both in startups and
          in larger organizations such as Novo Nordisk, Nets, and Nordea.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-8 font-small text-pretty text-gray-400">
          I'm passionate about helping teams navigate challenges and aligning technical directions
          with business objectives to deliver impactful results together, ensuring that everyone is
          heard and contributes to the shared goals.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-8 font-small text-pretty text-gray-400">
          Outside of work, I'm exploring the world of AI, which is my newfound passion. I enjoy
          travelling around the world and discovering new places, and staying active by playing
          basketball.
